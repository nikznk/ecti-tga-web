          <strong>I canâ€™t find my courses on Moodle. Where are they?</strong>
          <br />
          Moodle can be accessed directly via{" "}
          <a href="https://moodle.toiohomai.ac.nz">
            https://moodle.toiohomai.ac.nz

        <p>
          <strong>Where to I see all the student services?</strong>
          <br />
          For this we use getconnected.{" "}
          <a href="https://getconnected.toiohomai.ac.nz">
            https://getconnected.toiohomai.ac.nz
          </a>

          <strong>
            Can I store my files locally on a Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology
            PC?
          </strong>
          <br />
          On corporate machines (ie. library and drop-in lab on the first floor)
          you are able to store files on an H: drive. These drives cannot be
          access in a Pandora lab (DT219, DT303, DT308 and DT312).
          <br />
          You do however have access to a Google Drive, so if you wish to have
          access to your files on any pc, you are best to use that and access
          them via browser.
