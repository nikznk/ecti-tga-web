## What is Microsoft Imagine

At the beginning of each semester we set the students up with a Microsoft Imagine Account. This allows you to download some free products from Microsoft that you would otherwise have to pay for. Once you have graduated or are no longer with us, you can keep the software and licenses, but you will not be able to access the website anymore.

## Setting up your Microsoft Imagine Account

The details for your account have been sent to your `@student.toiohomai.ac.nz` email account which you can access here:

[Student Email](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?realm=student.toiohomai.ac.nz)

Once you have completed the sign up process (which is completely separate from your other accounts) you can then easily access the service by click on this link:

Below are some videos on how the process works. The looks are a little different, but the functionality is the same. (You can click on them to see bigger versions of them)
