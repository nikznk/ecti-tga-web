## Summer of Tech

You can earn from $6,000 -$10,000 during your summer holiday by landing an IT Internship. **FACT!**

Summer of Tech is a non-profit programme, which helps students from NZ tertiary institutions, find full-time PAID internships in the IT industry. Typically from November – February, students work on real tech projects with a host employer for approximately 400 hours where you develop practical and work-based skills.

And the best bit…you get PAID.
